[The research proposal](https://github.com/pgr-me/rasmussen-705.603/blob/main/Research%20Paper/Research_Paper_Proposal_Peter_Rasmussen.pdf) provides the aims of the project, which is to implement a Bayesian online changepoint detection algorithm to monitor deforestation. The goals outlined in the proposal are as follows:
* Implement an online change detection algorithm, roboBayes, in Python to make the algorithm more widely available to researchers.
* Explore a multi-resolution variation of roboBayes, MR roboBayes, using lower resolution sensor data.
* Validate Python implementation of roboBayes on publicly available annotations or self-made annotations.
