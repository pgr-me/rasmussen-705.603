# Data

Input data files for each assignment are provided in this directory. Each assignment has its own directory in data and each assignment has an input directory, raw, and an output directory, processed. Some assignments may include intermediate outputs, which are saved in interim. Inputs are immutable - they're never changed. Code in this repository is idempotent, meaning if the user runs the same code again outputs will always be the same (notwithstanding differences owing to intended stochasticity / randomness in the code).
